Hey everyone, how was your weekend?

Jamie (00:15)
It was great! Went hiking up in the mountains. The view was amazing.

Morgan (00:20)
That sounds awesome, Jamie. I just stayed in and caught up on some reading.

Alex (00:25)
Nice! What book were you reading, Morgan?

Morgan (00:27)
It’s called The Silent Patient. It’s a psychological thriller, and I couldn’t put it down.

Jamie (00:32)
I’ve heard of that one. How far along are you?

Morgan (00:35)
Almost done! I’m at the part where things are really starting to unravel.

Alex (00:40)
Sounds intense. Maybe I’ll pick it up next.
