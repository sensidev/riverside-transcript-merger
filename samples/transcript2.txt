Jamie (00:43)
You should, Alex. It’s a real page-turner. I love books that keep you guessing.

Morgan (00:47)
Same here! Any recommendations for my next read, Jamie?

Alex (00:50)
What about something lighter? I just finished Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine. It’s funny and heartwarming.

Jamie (00:55)
Oh, I’ve heard good things about that one too. I’ll add it to my list.

Morgan (00:58)
Thanks, Alex. I could use a change of pace after this thriller.

Alex (01:02)
No problem! It’s nice to have some variety in what we read, right?

Jamie (01:06)
Absolutely. Sometimes you need a break from all the suspense.

Morgan (01:09)
Exactly! I’ll let you both know how it goes with the next book.
